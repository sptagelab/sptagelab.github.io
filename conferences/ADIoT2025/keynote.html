			<h4><center><strong>Title: Artificial Intelligence for Network Security: Today and Tomorrow </strong></center></h4>
			<p>The dramatic development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) poses critical threat to network systems. Our communities are working hard for countermeasures and deep knowledge for the fields. In this talk, we would like to firstly browse the current landscape of the battle grounds. Secondly, we present the current promising efforts based on our study: theoretical tools, including digital differential geometry, group theory, et al., and their applications in practice. Thirdly, we will also report the cross discipline and cross technology methodologies deployed in the domain. We hope the talk will shed light on the fields for energetic researchers at this unfolding history of AI age.</p>

			<h4><center><strong>Title: Federated Learning: Security and Privacy Attacks and Possible Solutions </strong></center></h4>
			<p>
				Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized method for training machine learning models, where local nodes retain data and only share learning parameters with other nodes, thereby enhancing privacy and data security. There are some potential attacks that compromise security and privacy concern of the data. In model poisoning attacks, some of the nodes are compromised, and the attacker may inject false information to degrade the performance of the consolidated model. Data poisoning and model poisoning, where adversaries share the incorrect local model with the central server, are potential methods for model poisoning attacks. Sybil attacks and collusion attacks are also paramount concerns for AI researchers, in which attackers create multiple malicious nodes that participate in the federated learning process, triggering their influence on the global model and attackers are able to generate the skewed model. Another attack is an inference attack, in which attackers attempt to get the sensitive information that was used in the training process. While in free-rider attacks, some nodes do not participate in the training process and keeps the advantages of globally-trained models. In model replacement attacks, attackers may share their own crafted model to update the global model as per their requirements. After several training rounds, an attacker gradually shifts the global model parameters by sharing a pre-trained malicious model. The gradient leakage attacks may deduce important insights from the gradients.
Byzantine node-based collusion attack, one of the most sensitive attacks will be discussed in detail. The possibility of collusion attacks occurring and their possible remedies will be explored in detail. Some algorithms based on robust aggregation methods, anomaly detection, reputation systems, redundancy, and cross-checking are quite popular. Particularly reputation-based mechanism will be focussed on.

			<h5><center>About Prof. Anderson</center></h5>
			<p>
				&emsp;&emsp;Ross Anderson is a pioneer and world leader in security engineering, and is distinguished for starting a number of new areas of research in hardware, software and systems.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;His early work on how systems fail established a base of empirical evidence for building threat models for a wide range of applications from banking to healthcare.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;He has made trailblazing contributions that helped establish a number of new research topics, including security usability, hardware tamper-resistance, information hiding, and the analysis of application programming interfaces.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;He is also one of the founders of the study of information security economics, which not only illuminates where the most effective attacks and defences may be found, but is also of fundamental importance to making policy for the information society.

			<h4><center><strong>The PRIVACY UNIVERSE – can this contribute to a better learning about online privacy?</strong></center></h4>
			<p>
				&emsp;&emsp;There is far from Zuckerberg’s vision in 2010 saying “privacy is no longer a social norm” to now, where GDPR enforces companies to pay attention to users’ private data, and where it becomes clearer that private data is a human right.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;The relatively relaxed way people share private data, has questioned if they are interested in digital privacy and have sufficient knowledge about the subject. This talk will discuss this perception by explaining about a teaching and learning tool named the privacy universe.<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;The universe is based on Capture the Flag principles but places challenges within the environment of different social media that people know and use. In the talk there will be examples from the privacy universe and discussions about how it can be used in teaching of young people.
