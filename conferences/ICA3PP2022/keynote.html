                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    As humans, things, software and AI continue to become the entangled fabric of distributed systems, systems engineers and researchers are facing novel challenges. In this talk, we analyze the role of IoT, Edge, and Cloud, as well as AI in the co-evolution of distributed systems for the new decade. We identify challenges and discuss a roadmap that these new distributed systems have to address. We take a closer look at how a cyber-physical fabric will be complemented by AI operationalization to enable seamless end-to-end distributed systems.

                  <h3>Trust, Security and Privacy of 5G Positioning</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    The fifth-generation (5G) cellular network is expected to provide sub-meter positioning accuracy without draining the battery of user equipment. As a solution, ultra-dense network (UDN) deployment and network-based positioning were proposed. However, the openness of UDN and the vulnerability of network devices (e.g., access nodes) make such a positioning system easy to be attacked. Moreover, due to the sensitivity of positions, the privacy protection in both 5G positioning and its further application in location-based services (LBSs) has been paid special attention. However, existing work lacks deep investigation on the trust, security and privacy of 5G positioning and its related LBS provision. In this talk, I will report our research results on these issues, including a number of schemes to overcome jamming and collusion attacks in 5G positioning with positioning data truth discovery and potential attacker tracing, to protect privacy for both end users and LBS providers during LBS provision, and verifiable positioning with privacy preservation. Theoretical analysis and experimental tests show the effectiveness of our schemes and their potential in practical deployment.

                  <h3>Future of digital identity management in decentralised and distributed settings</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    Covid-19 has accelerated the digital transformation in all industry verticals. With the digital transformation there is an increasing need to have secure, trustworthy and reliable forms of digital identities. In addition the current data protection regulations expect the data owner to have total control in the way they share any personal data. Traditional identity management techniques have too much reliance on identity providers and were centralised and are not suitable for user-centric decentralised and distributed next generation internet. This talk will discuss the existing identity management architectures and provide a foundation based on the self-sovereign identity which can help to develop a sustainable, greener and distributed identity management framework.

                  <h3>How to Attack and Generate Honeywords</h3>
                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    In recent years, a large number of high-profile sites have leaked user password files. What's more, these leaks often take months or even years for websites to detect and remind users to update their passwords, but it's too late. For example, Yahoo leaked three billion user passwords and various personally identifiable information (e.g., birthday and name) in August 2013, yet only detected until October 2021. This provides attackers enough time to crack/exploit user passwords.<br>
                    A promising approach, named honeywords, was first proposed by Juels and Rivest at CCSâ13 to achieve timely password breach detection. We found that Juels-Rivestâs four primary honeyword-generation methods have serious security flaws, and such heuristic methods cannot be easily patched. We propose a series of theoretic models for characterizing the attackerâs best attack strategies in telling apart the real password from a set of honeywords. This resolves the open question of âgiven the attack capabilities, how does the attacker perform the optimal attackâ. In turn, the attacker's best attacking strategies can be used to design best honeyword-generation methods, successfully getting rid of the heuristic design. This addresses the question of how best to attack, design and evaluate honeyword-generation methods. We believe this work provides both theoretical and methodological basis for timely detecting password-file leakage, pushing the honeyword research towards statistical rigor.

                  <hr>
                  <p>
                    As to paving the last mile of enabling intelligent applications on ubiquitous edge devices, it is necessary to deploy the entire lifecycle (ecosystem) of data generation, representation extraction and model consumption near the user side, with the support of diverse machine learning techniques. This emerging scenario promotes the rise of Neural-enhanced Edge Perception (NEP) system, which handles the end-to-end processing procedure by synthetically optimizing the key components of large-scale learning paradigm, hardware-adaptive neural architecture and communication-efficient cross-device interaction. As a fundamental infrastructure to bring edge intelligence to the production environment, the NEP system offers great advantages in terms of multi-modality knowledge fusion, lightweight on-device analysis, real-time streaming processing and perfect rate-distortion balance on distributed collaborative devices. This talk gives a comprehensive inspection of implementing high-performance NEP systems, covering the realistic design challenges, possible solutions and promising research opportunities </p>
