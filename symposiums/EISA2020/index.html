                   <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                   <p class="lead">Password remains the most widespread means of authentication, especially on the Internet. As such, it is the Achilles heel of many modern systems. We witnessed the trend of recurring breaches where (salted) password databases get stolen. This is disastrous as low-entropy passwords can be guessed by brute-force attacks easily.

                     Facebook pioneered using a cryptographic server to harden password-based authentication. We call it password-hardening (PH) service. The crypto server serves as a helper in the validation process and as a rate-limiter to thwart online dictionary attack. We first show that the PH scheme of Schneider et al. (ACM CCS '16) is vulnerable to offline attacks just after a single validation query. We then suggest stronger security definitions, and an even more efficient construction, Phoenix, to achieve them. It can handle up to three times more than Pythia (USENIX Security '15), the first and the only solution remains secure before our work.

                     PH only provides user-authentication but cannot provide confidentiality of sensitive user data (e.g., credit card number for an e-commerce site).  Although encryption somewhat alleviates the problem, decryption is often needed for utility, and keeping the decryption key within reach is obviously dangerous. To address this seemingly unavoidable problem, we propose the notion of password-hardened encryption (PHE).

                     PHE inherits the security features of PH, in particular, the crypto rate-limiter learns neither the password nor the sensitive data, while validating the password and helping in decryption.  More importantly, both the crypto rate-limiter and the crypto-service client can rotate their secret keys, providing a proactive security mechanism mandated by the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. We build an extremely simple PHE which can handle more than 525 encryption and (successful) decryption requests per second per core on a 10-core Intel Xeon E5-2640 CPU.

                     This talk is based on two papers appeared in USENIX Security 2017 and 2018.

                      lives of billions of people, who have developed an unprecedented
                      reliance on smart phones and tablets compared to any previous
                      computing technology. With the trend of bring your own device, mobile
                      devices are increasingly used to access and store sensitive corporate
                      information as well. However, not only mobile devices and applications
                      present a unique set of risks to personal privacy, they also pose new
                      security challenges to enterprise information systems. This talk will
                      provide an overview of the research activities conducted in the Secure
                      Mobile Center at the Singapore Management University, from techniques
                      to fortifying mobile platforms with a user centric trust anchor,

                    <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">When we think about security and privacy, we try and tend to
                      establish a consistent model to design and evaluate technologies. Such a
                      model helps understandings of problems, development of theory and
                      technologies over the same common ground. Thus, we believe that creating
                      a concrete model and goal for a kind of technologies are required to
                      achieve enough security and privacy.

                      Recent progress of application protocol raises a question to such a
                      style of security research. Bitcoin, a protocol proposed in an anonymous
                      paper without a consistent model and peer review, realizes unexpected
                      economic impacts than other cryptographic protocols. The protocol is a
                      beautiful combination of many different kinds of theoretical
                      backgrounds; hence, the reverse-engineering to produce a consistent
                      model is hard, and there are no successful attempts to obtain it. Beyond
                      Bitcoin, blockchain is expected to be used for broad applications than
                      payment in Bitcoin. For those wide ranges of applications, we need to
                      deal with additional many uncertain factors to evaluate security and privacy of blockchain based
                      systems, over the bitcoin which still lacks a consistent model. System
                      model, trust model and decentralization, security assumptions, and
                      performance requirements are in a trade-off relationship. Designers of
                      each blockchain based system deal with elusive and non-static security
                      and privacy model.

                      In this keynote, I will show how bitcoin and blockchain give a new
                      perspective to analyze the nature of these protocols, and what is needed
                      for security researchers to deal with practical but elusive technologies.</p>

Existing user authentication practices based on traditional cryptography and biometric techniques have become largely insufficient, if not ineffective, as we move into the AI and IoT era.  In order to address this challenge, smartphones have been widely explored by both academia and industry as a readily available possession device of the users. In this talk, we explore the technique of camera fingerprinting to develop a brand-new hardware-rooted smartphone authentication mechanism. Various security issues underlying the proposed  authentication mechanism are discussed in-depth. The usability of the proposed solution is also demonstrated through real-world experiments.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">Machine learning has achieved impressive results in a wide variety of
                      computing problems, including computer vision, speech recognition,
                      content filtering, anomaly detection, and competitive game playing.
                      However, the models in machine learning are often insecure, both from
                      a confidentiality and an integrity point of view.  In a
                      confidentiality compromise, say involving a machine learning model
                      mapping symptoms to disease diagnosis, an attacker could extract from
                      the model data about specific individuals used in its training.
                      Integrity compromises include the possibility that an attacker subtly
                      alters query data, for example by modifying the pixel values of an
                      image in ways that can't be detected by a human viewer, in order to
                      achieve a particular result.

                      The talk will introduce machine learning, and review existing attacks
