                          With recent evolution of adversarial techniques, intrusions have become more complex that may threaten the security of various assets regarding information and applications. In addition, coordinated intrusions like worm outbreak can continue to be a major threat to information, system and network security in the near future. The popularity of Internet may generate a large volume of different types of sensitive information. Therefore, there is a need for emerging techniques, theories and applications to protect information and practical security. <br><br>

                          The Third International Conference on Emerging Information Security and Applications (EISA)  aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners across the world to exchange their ideas.

      <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
      <p class="lead">
        Attribute-based encryption scheme is a promising mechanism to realize one-to-many fine-grained access control which strengthens the security in cloud computing. However, massive amounts of data and various data sharing requirements bring great challenges to the complex but isolated and fixed access structures in most of the existing attribute-based encryption schemes. <br />
        In this talk, we introduce an attribute-based hierarchi- cal encryption scheme with extendable policy, called Extendable Hierarchical Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (EH- CP-ABE), to improve the data sharing efficiency and security simultaneously. The scheme realizes the function of hierarchical encryption, in which, data with hierarchical access control relationships could be encrypted together flexibly to improve the efficiency. It also achieves external and internal extension of the access structure to further encrypt newly added hierarchical data without updating the original ciphertexts or with only a minor update depending on the data sharing requirements, which simplifies the encryption process and greatly reduces the computation overhead.

      <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
      <p class="lead">
        In the digital era, where most of our daily communications are done over computer networks, the problem of privacy protection has become increasingly important and challenging. To address this problem, various privacy-preserving cryptographic constructions have been proposed since the 1980s. <br />
        In this talk, I will focus on privacy-preserving cryptographic systems that provide users’ authentication in the multiuser setting. I will discuss a tension between users and authorities, between privacy and accountability in the existing systems. Then I will describe several recent innovative ideas for resolving this tension, aiming to achieve a “privacy vs. accountability” balance that is reasonably fair for both users and authorities.

		<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
		<p class="lead">
			In recent years, we have witnessed a remarkable proliferation of networked intelligent devices - collectively known as the Internet of Things (IoT). The “smartness” of IoT is empowered by data-driven and learning-based techniques to enhance cognition, prediction, and decision-making. It often requires a sheer amount of data from various organizations and end users to be collected, transmitted, and processed. Privacy is a fundamental hurdle to such collective data aggregation and analysis across different entities. <br />
			In this talk, we will discuss about lightweight computation for secure evaluating/retrieval data, and privacy-preserving federated learning in IoT Environments. This goal will lead to the generation of new crypto models for IoT devices supporting Artificial Intelligence.

		<h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
		<p class="lead">
			In the modern information society, public-key cryptosystems are preserving our private information and communication security. The security of current public-key cryptosystems such as RSA or ECC relies on the hardness of factoring large integers or solving discrete logarithm problems. However, it is proved that these computational problems can be solved in polynomial time by running Shor’s quantum algorithm in a practical quantum computer. This vulnerability has prompted research into post-quantum cryptography (PQC) using alternative mathematical problems that shall be secure in the era of quantum computers. <br />
			In this talk, I will give an overview of the progress and recent trends in post-quantum cryptography. In particular, I will introduce the PQC standardization project started by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2016. Four cryptosystems were selected to be standardized in 2022, including a lattice-based PKE/KEM and three (two lattice-based and one hash-based) digital signatures. I will show a general procedure for establishing a primitive lattice-based cryptosystem and explain the state-of-the-art security evaluation for lattice-based cryptosystems.
