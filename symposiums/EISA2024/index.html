                          With recent evolution of adversarial techniques, intrusions have become more complex that may threaten the security of various assets regarding information and applications. In addition, coordinated intrusions like worm outbreak can continue to be a major threat to information, system and network security in the near future. The popularity of Internet may generate a large volume of different types of sensitive information. Therefore, there is a need for emerging techniques, theories and applications to protect information and practical security. <br><br>

                          The 5th International Conference on Emerging Information Security and Applications (EISA)  aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners across the world to exchange their ideas. It seeks original submissions that discuss practical or theoretical solutions to enhance the information and application security in practice. <br><br>

                   <p class="lead">Internet of Vehicles (IoV) enables the interconnection and data exchange between vehicles (V2V) and between vehicles and roadside infrastructure (V2I), enhancing traffic safety and efficiency. However, due to the open and broadcast nature of wireless communication, attackers can easily tamper with or forge data transmitted by vehicles, potentially causing traffic disruption. Therefore, secure data sharing mechanisms are crucial for the IoV. Additionally, given the private nature of vehicle data, sharing this information must not compromise the privacy of vehicle owners. This report presents methods for secure data sharing in the Internet of Vehicles. </p>

                 <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">Intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) represent the fusion of intelligent and network technologies with traditional vehicles, with the vehicle-road-cloud integrated development path becoming an industry consensus. However, the frequent data exchange across terminal, edge, and cloud systems poses multiple security challenges, including secure data transmission, cross-domain data untrustworthiness, and the inapplicability of unified models. To address these issues, an integrated security protection system based on "active and passive integration, cross-domain collaboration, and cloud-edge-terminal coordination" is proposed. This system enhances data security, model update efficiency, and cross-domain trustworthiness through cross-domain security sharing methods and a unified anomaly detection model. The report further showcases innovative solutions and experimental validations in data encryption, anomaly detection, and multi-domain collaboration, providing robust technical support for the secure development of ICVs.

                    <p class="lead">Learning-enabled Cyber-Physical Systems (LE-CPS), including autonomous vehicles and unmanned drones, hold great promise but also raise significant concerns about safety and reliability. Unlike traditional software, these LE-CPS integrate deep neural networks with
logic-based modules, creating unique challenges for software testing. Despite advances in testing techniques, the practical needs of industry practitioners for safety and formal guarantees have not yet been fully addressed. To tackle these complex challenges, I have led a team of world-leading experts to establish the Trusted Autonomy Working Group (TACPS.org). In this presentation, I will first briefly discuss two of our FSE’22 papers that provide a comprehensive study of current testing practices and test reduction strategies in autonomous vehicles. I will then highlight a recent FSE’24 paper that revives model-based testing in LE-CPS using large language models, followed by related work in TSE’24 and ICSE’25 on generating driving scenarios with large language models and creating an online testing environment to enhance drone autolanding
systems. Finally, I will cover our recent paper on the neuro-symbolic paradigm, which aims to improve the interpretability, testability, and verifiability of LE-CPS.

                    <p class="lead">Trust management is important for building a secure distributed environment against insider attacks, and it is the same for collaborative intrusion detection, which can enhance the detection accuracy by allowing different nodes to share required information and data.
Under challenge-based CIDN, a node can send a special message called challenge to test the reputation of a target node.  However, cyber attackers may still take advantage of some advanced insider attacks to compromise such system. In this talk, we introduce passive message fingerprint attack (PMFA) and analyze how to defeat such advanced attack in practice.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">We are increasingly witnessing how Electric Vehicles (EVs) are having a great acceptance and impact on everyday life, as well as their charging infrastructures that are part of the well-known microgrid-based systems. The vast majority of their cyber-physical systems are prone to multiple types of (cyber)attacks, affecting not only their own physical and logical elements, including their communication systems, but also putting at risk the energy resources of the microgrid itself. In this Keynote, we will focus the study on the security of EV charging infrastructures, whose management can rely heavily on the de facto OCPP protocol to control components and energy transactions, as well as the implications of the new stakeholders in this management process. That is, the objective of this presentation is to analyze the evolution of the protocol, exploring some interesting threats in the latest version of OCPP and possible countermeasures. For the latter, the most recent recommendations given by European experts in the supply chain field are introduced, although adapted to the energy context.

                                  <h3><strong>Bio</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">Cristina Alcaraz is an Associate Professor at the Computer Science Department of the University of Malaga (UMA). She has been awarded with two competitive postdoctoral fellowships: Marie-Curie in 2012 and Ramon-y-Cajal in 2015, and was a guest researcher at NIST (2011-2012) visiting later the Royal Holloway (2012-2014, under the Marie-Curie fellowship), UCBM (2017, Rome) and the University of Piraeus (2019, Athens). She is involved in European and national research projects, on topics related to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) with interest in the security of Smart Grids, Industry 4.0/5.0, Digital Twins, Industrial Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, focusing the research on advanced detection and resilience. In addition to this, she serves on the Editorial Boards of international journals in the area (e.g.,International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection, ACM Distributed Ledger Technologies: Research and Practice), and participates as Principal Researcher in several research projects on CIP.

            <h3 style="font-style: italic;"> Machine learning models are valuable IP of their owners due to the tremendous amount of
expertise, effort, and computing power involved in designing, training, validating, and commercializing them. In this talk, we will first discuss challenges in designing watermarks given relevant adaptive attacks and then generalize the requirements for watermarks to survive those attacks. Finally, we will present some watermarking approaches in different scenarios.
