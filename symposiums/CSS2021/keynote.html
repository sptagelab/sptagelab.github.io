                    <p class="lead">Wireless body area network (WBAN) and big data techniques indubitably enable the online medical diagnosis system to be more practical. In the system, to make a more accurate diagnosis, doctors wish to obtain some archived medical data records, which are similar to the sensed patient data, to learn from the prior diagnoses.  As a practically useful similarity search, the dynamic skyline query can provide doctors with similar data records having all possible relative weights of attributes. Driven by the powerful cloud, the data owner often outsources encrypted data and the corresponding services, e.g., dynamic skyline query services here, to a third-party cloud. As a result, it is required to perform the dynamic skyline query over encrypted data. However, existing schemes are either insecure or inefficient. To address the issue, in this work, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving dynamic skyline query scheme and use it in an online medical diagnosis system. Specifically, based on symmetric homomorphic encryption (SHE), we present a set of efficient and secure protocols to achieve various operations, such as less than comparison, equality test, and dominance determination, without leaking any sensitive information to the cloud. With these secure protocols, we carefully design our dynamic skyline query scheme to attain full security and high efficiency at the same time. Detailed security analysis shows that our proposed scheme is indeed privacy-preserving. With extensive experimental evaluations, we show that our proposed scheme outperforms the alternative scheme by two orders of magnitude in the computational cost and at least 8.1x in the communication cost.

                   <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                   <p class="lead">Biometrics concerns the study of automated methods for identifying an individual by measuring one or more physical or behavioral features of him. Certain physical human features or behaviors are characteristics that are specific and can be uniquely associated to one person. Retinas, iris, DNA, fingerprint, palm print, or pattern of finger lengths are typical physical features that are specific to individuals. Also the voice print, gait, or handwriting can be used to this purpose.
Nowadays biometrics is rapidly evolving. This science is getting more and more accurate in identifying persons and behaviors. Consequently, these technologies become more and more attractive and effective in critical applications, such as to create safe personal IDs, to control the access to personal information or physical areas, to recognize terrorists or criminals, to study the movements of people, and to monitor the human behavior. 
The use of biometrics in the real life often requires very complex signal and image processing and scene analysis, for example encompassing biometric feature extraction and identification, individual tracking, face tracking, eye tracking, liveness/anti-spoofing tests, and facial expression recognition.
Artificial intelligence techniques (including neural networks, fuzzy logic, evolutionary computing, and multi-agent systems) have been proved to be useful and effective in addressing this kind of data processing, especially when it is difficult to identify an algorithm while sufficiently descriptive examples are available, or when fuzzy descriptions are more natural to capture the essence of the problem, or when complex non-linear optimization is needed, or when multiple agents cooperate in solving the application problem. 
This talk will review the domain of biometrics, its applications in various domains and the relevance of artificial intelligence, in particular neural networks and deep learning) to effectively solve various problems in these applications.

In this talk, we discuss reasons for this situation, and how to realistically introduce basic security features into such an environment. We provide an overview on recent offensive and defensive work for embedded realtime operating systems, their constraints on opportunities, and propose complementary approaches focusing on realtime monitoring of legacy host systems.</p>

                    <h3><strong>Abstract</strong></h3>
                    <p class="lead">The booming growth and rapid development in embedded systems, wireless  communications, sensing techniques and emerging support for cloud computing and social networks have enabled researchers and practitioners to create a wide variety of Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS) that reason intelligently, act autonomously, and respond to the users' needs in a context and situation-aware manner.  The CPSS are the integration of computation, communication and control with the physical world, human knowledge and sociocultural elements. It is a novel emerging computing paradigm and has attracted wide concerns from both industry and academia in recent years.

Currently, CPSS are still in their infancy stage. Our first ongoing research is to study effective and efficient approaches for CPSS modeling and general system design automation methods, as well as methods analyzing and/or improving their power and energy, security, trust and reliability features. Once the CPSS have been designed, they collect massive data (Volume) from the physical world by various physical perception devices (Variety) in structured/semi-structured/unstructured format and respond the users' requirements immediately (Velocity) and provide the proactive services (Veracity) for them in physical space or social space. These collected big data are normally high dimensional, redundant and noisy, and many beyond the processing capacity of the computer systems. Our second ongoing research is focused on the Big Data-as-a-Service framework, which includes data representation, dimensionality reduction, incremental and distributed processing, security and privacy, deep learning, clustering, prediction and proactive services, aiming at representing and processing big data generated from CPSS, providing more valued smart services for human and refining the previously designed CPSS.

This talk will present our latest research on these two directions. Corresponding case studies in some applications such as smart traffics will be shown to demonstrate the feasibility and flexibility of the proposed system design methodology and analytic framework.

Governments are investing significantly in response to the risks and challenges while researchers and vendors are aggressively developing and marketing new technologies aimed at protecting critical infrastructure.

I will present a few novel technologies developed in iTrust for preventing and detecting attacks to CPS. I will further introduce the fully operational CPS testbeds in iTrust, and show how the testbeds are used to validate the security technologies so that the owners and operators of critical infrastructure can be confident that the technologies to be deployed will actually protect their systems in the event of a cyber war.
